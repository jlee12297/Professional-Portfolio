# Professional-Portfolio
Professional portfolio page, w/ easy access to viewing of previous projects and contact information.
Extremely beginner level portfolio page. Need to work greatly on building webpages from scratch given no code. Struggled to style to page w/flexboxes, and most likely have a lot of redundant code in both the index and the css page. Portfolio page includes a functional navigation bar which will scroll to the appropriate section, as well as functioning links in the contact me section for both emailing me, and taking the user to my github page. The work section links for now only has one "work", which is the first code clean up project I worked on, as well as 3 future project sections that just take the user to my personal githubpage.
